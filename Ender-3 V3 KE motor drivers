Here's how to use the stepper motor drivers on the Creality Ender-3 V3 KE board:

Pin name:	  Function:
TP16		    Enable (all motors)
TP14		    X Step
TP13		    X Dir
TP17		    Y Step
TP15		    Y Dir
TP20		    Z Step
TP18		    Z Dir
TP21		    E Step
TP19	  	  E Dir

No programming is needed, just solder connectors to these pins on the back of the board and controll the stepper drivers with arduino, esp32 or similar.
